== If_vs_begin
How:
1) Run rails in production mode 
Under UNIX-like OS:
Run time ruby test_begin.rb 
Run time ruby test_if.rb

After each test you should have 3 values in seconds (Sys, User, Real). Compare it with data set from another test,
less value is better. 
Also you should experiment with Random param in test_* files, theoretically greater Rand should give us better results for exceptions.
